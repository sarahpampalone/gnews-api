This project is a take home assessment from Coderbyte, where the task was to create a simple API that can interest with a public news API, GNews, to fetch articles. I have chosen to use Python for this project in order to demonstrate my control over multiple languages, as I have shown competency with both Java and Javascript in previous Coderbyte assessments. Several methods are included that interact with the API to produce the user's desired content as they are guided with a series of match statements.

# Instructions
Please make sure that the files remain in one directory to ensure the program runs correctly.
The program should be run in the main.py file.

# How it works
The user will be guided step by step through the search process, being prompted by a series of print statements that lead into match or if statements in a specific, detailed manner. 
Once the selected series of questions conclude, their specifications become parameters to external functions that produce the desired content. 
Failsafe measures have been taken to ensure that the program does not reach a dead end. Examples of these failsafes include while loops to avoid invalid inputs, overloading methodology within match statements, and automatic converting of spaces into URL format.

# Disclosure
Due to the limitations of the free GNews account, the maximum number of results is 10 articles.
